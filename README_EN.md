### *Empowering Mental Health through AI*

---

## ðŸŒŸ Project Statement
HearMeGLM is the realization of a concept that I designed independently, not influenced by others' projects. This project has demanded a lot of thought, effort, and creativity to bring it to life, and Iâ€™m proud to share my code with the community. Thank you for visiting, and for your support in this endeavor! (*^_^*)

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
HearMeGLM is my final project for this semesterâ€™s Large Language Models course. The goal is to fine-tune the ChatGLM-6B foundation model to create a virtual counselor, capable of engaging in empathetic and supportive dialogue. This project is not just an assignment but a way to deepen my understanding of mental health challenges, reflecting my aspirations to contribute to this field as an AI student. I hope HearMeGLM will inspire further ideas about how AI can support mental wellness.
