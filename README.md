# HearMeGLM 🌱

### *Empowering Mental Health through AI*

---

## 🌟 Project Statement
HearMeGLM is the realization of a concept that I designed independently, not influenced by others' projects. This project has demanded a lot of thought, effort, and creativity to bring it to life, and I’m proud to share my code with the community. Thank you for visiting, and for your support in this endeavor! (*^_^*)

## 📖 Project Overview
HearMeGLM is my final project for this semester’s Large Language Models course. The goal is to fine-tune the ChatGLM-6B foundation model to create a virtual counselor, capable of engaging in empathetic and supportive dialogue. This project is not just an assignment but a way to deepen my understanding of mental health challenges, reflecting my aspirations to contribute to this field as an AI student. I hope HearMeGLM will inspire further ideas about how AI can support mental wellness.
